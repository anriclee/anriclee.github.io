Initially, due to issues with my Visual Studio Code IDE, I couldn't type Chinese. I was forced to write my thoughts in English, which led to the birth of these English blog posts.

As time went on, I discovered that using a language I'm less familiar with compelled me to express ideas more simply and organize my thoughts more carefully. Additionally, I noticed that the most readable technical books I've read were predominantly in English. Furthermore, LLMs seem to handle English queries more efficiently and effectively.

Are these just my impressions? Perhaps.

Nevertheless, I've decided to continue writing in English.

Today, I read a chapter titled *Process* from an OS textbook recommended by JYY, an Operating Systems professor at NJU. I wish I had discovered this book earlierâ€”my understanding of operating systems might not be so limited if I had. Still, as the saying goes, "The best time to plant a tree was 10 years ago; the second best time is now."

Now, let's dive into IT!
