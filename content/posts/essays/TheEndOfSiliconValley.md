Finally I have finihsed watching the entire HBO series "Silicon Valley" after having seen the first four seasons several years ago. Back then, I was more struck by the unique humor of coders - a distinct group in a unique phase of society. However, this time, the spirit of being a geek left a profound impression on me. In other words, I finally understood the essence of technology.

The leading role, Richard, is not handsome, not is he a hero. On the contrary, he is selfish, awkwardly thin and sometimes a typical jerk. However, when I consider his position from another perspective, I cannot be certain that I would behave any better than him. Not to mention, he has a great programming talent. There were several moments when I realized that humanities exists in this coding spirit instead of those philosophical books in HISTORY. 

As a coder or an engineer, sometimes I feel bored with the JOB I am doing, thinking that the things I am busy at lack of some phylosophy feeling. And now , I changed my IDEA. As far as I am concerned, phylosophy is born to solve the problems human face. If there is nothing to do with our real life, then the life of phylosophy go to an end. Therefore, maybe every generation has the different problems to solve. We cannot only focus our perspective on the HISTORY, instead more eyes should focused on the modern society. Like the end of the series,where Richard, Jared, Dinesh confront the problems of PHYLOSOPHY , and not only the techniques. 

Therefore, this society sucks but we perhaps fortunately meet the transmitting times rarely appeared in the LONG LONG history. Whatever we may have a feeling of current times, suprises may appear somewhere, and I am looking forward to it !

"Always blue", to the Geek Spirit!
