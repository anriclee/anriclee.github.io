Finnaly, the whole alarm process worked out today ! During the process, I found myself lack of more knowlege about Docker/Kubernetes which I will manage all them sooner or later. 

Prometheus is a powerful tool to monitor the state of microservice. Its design is worth learning. I have downloaded all the source codes , its clear design impress me deeply. The design is a little different from the normal way Chinese codes usually take. 

The implements of PromSQL and Alarm rules trigger are the main focus now. Perhaps I can know someting about how to design a database through this way.

Then the compression of log is also worth reading which I am right now interested in ,inspired by the HBO series *Sillicon Valley*.

April 23rd.
