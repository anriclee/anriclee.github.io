It’s been years since I last wrote a blog—not even one in Chinese. I’d almost forgotten how to generate a new post with Hugo. So much has changed, and life’s pressures have piled up in ways words can hardly capture. Maybe that line from Friends rings true: "Life sucks, but you’re gonna love it."

The years have been a mix of highs and lows. There were moments when motivation vanished entirely, leaving me silent, unable to articulate even the simplest feelings.

But let’s return to the title.

I can’t recall exactly when I first watched *The Silicon Valley*. Perhaps seven years ago? What matters is this: every rewatch reignites my passion for technology. It reminds me how cool tech truly is—how it tangibly transforms lives. The first two seasons are full of humors that only IT workes can get. 

Now, with LLMs (large language models) at our fingertips, curiosity and persistent questioning seem to unlock mastery of almost anything. This excites me. I firmly believe public knowledge is on the brink of a massive leap forward, and the coming revolution is worth anticipating.

Remember Richard’s compression algorithm in the show? The public’s awe mirrored my own dormant fascination with encoding techniques—a subject I once dismissed as tedious during college. Given time to revisit it, I suspect I’d find beauty in the math I once resented.

This marks my first English blog. Moving forward, I’ll share insights on IT, one post at a time.
