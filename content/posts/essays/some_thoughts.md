Not even a good shell tools found under windows for now. This leads me to think that if I can develop it in Rust or Golang.

My demands are simple, a beautiful GUI , a tool for transfer files, uploading or downloading. 

Maybe I will try electron, but the size is so big, I am hesitating about it.

And probably fyne.io or Wails are also alternatives I would choose.

As I want to grasp Rust programming language, sometimes I want to develop one by Rust language either.

Making a choice is such a boring thing.
