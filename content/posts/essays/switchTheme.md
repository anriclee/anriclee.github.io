This is probably my last time *switching to a theme made by others*. That's my commitment.

Moving forward, I plan to create my own theme using my frontend knowledge and build it entirely from scratch.

I have to admit that choosing a blog theme can be quite anxiety-inducing.

From now on, I will focus on my first source code reading series about *Prometheus*.

I plan to share my understanding through a series of articles.
